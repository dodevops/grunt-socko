This is a cartridge collector:

Completely:

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello World!";
}
int test()
{
   std::cout << "foo bar!";
}
  "dynamic": "This is dynamic content from the root!"
test2 = test
This is the second dynamic content from the root.
<dynamic>This is dynamic content from the root</dynamic>
